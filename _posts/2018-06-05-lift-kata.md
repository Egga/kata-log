## The Lift Kata

Since lifts are everywhere and they contain software, how easy would it be to write a basic one?
Well, you are about to find out. TDD a lift, starting with simple behaviors and working toward complex ones. 
Assume good input from calling code and concentrate on the main flow.
 
* a lift responds to calls containing a source floor and direction
* a lift has an attribute floor, which describes it's current location
* a lift delivers passengers to requested floors
* you may implement current floor monitor
* you may implement direction arrows
* you may implement doors (opening and closing)
* you may implement DING!
* there can be more than one lift


## Advanced Requirements
* a lift does not respond immediately. consider options to simulate time, possibly a tick method.
* lift calls are queued, and executed only as the lift passes a floor

## Objects Only
Can you write a lift that does not need to be queried? Try writing a lift that only sends messages to other objects.
